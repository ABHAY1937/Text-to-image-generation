# Text-to-image-generation
Text-to-Image Generation with Hugging Face Transformer and Stable Diffusion
Generated Image

This project demonstrates how to generate images from text descriptions using the Hugging Face Transformer model and the Stable Diffusion framework with PyTorch. It combines the power of pre-trained language models with state-of-the-art image generation techniques.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-to-image-generation.git
cd text-to-image-generation
Install the required dependencies (see Dependencies section).

Run the provided script to generate images from text.

Dependencies
This project requires the following dependencies:

Python 3.6+
PyTorch
Hugging Face Transformers
Stable Diffusion (Make sure to follow the installation instructions in its README)
You can install the Python dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install torch transformers
For Stable Diffusion, please refer to the official repository for installation instructions: Stable Diffusion on GitHub

Usage
To generate images from text, use the provided script generate_image.py. You can run it as follows:

bash
Copy code
python generate_image.py --text "A beautiful landscape with mountains and a river."
Replace the text argument with your desired text description. The script will use the Hugging Face Transformer model and Stable Diffusion to generate an image based on the text input.

The generated image will be saved in the output_images directory by default.

Examples
Here are some example text inputs and the corresponding generated images:

Input: "A cozy cabin in the woods with a fireplace."
Generated Image

Input: "A futuristic cityscape at night with neon lights."
Generated Image

Input: "A serene beach with palm trees and a clear blue ocean."
Generated Image

Feel free to experiment with different text inputs and explore the capabilities of this text-to-image generation system.
